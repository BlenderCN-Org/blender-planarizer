Tired of dealing with non-planar quads? Want to flatten some vertices to an axis that isn't necessarily one of the 3 boring cardinal ones?  Perfectly happy with the surface normals of the polygons you already have?

Introducing Planarizer!


## Basic instructions 
 - Select vertices in edit mode
 - Hover mouse over face to act as plane-source
